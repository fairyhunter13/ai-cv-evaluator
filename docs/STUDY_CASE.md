- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/fairyhunter13/ai-cv-evaluator

## Solution Overview

### Initial Plan
The project aimed to build a comprehensive backend service that evaluates candidates' CVs and project reports against job requirements using AI/LLM workflows. The system was designed following Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns between domain, use cases, and adapters.

Key planned features:
- RESTful API endpoints for document upload, evaluation triggering, and result retrieval
- Asynchronous job processing with queue-based architecture
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for context-aware evaluation
- Multi-provider AI support with fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive observability with metrics, tracing, and logging
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### System & Database Design

#### API Design
The API follows OpenAPI 3.0 specification with three main endpoints:
- `POST /v1/upload` - Multipart form upload for CV and project documents
- `POST /v1/evaluate` - Triggers evaluation with idempotency support
- `GET /v1/result/{id}` - Retrieves evaluation results with ETag caching

#### Database Schema (ERD)
```sql
uploads (id, content_hash, file_name, mime_type, extracted_text, created_at)
jobs (id, cv_id, project_id, status, idempotency_key, error_message, created_at, updated_at)
results (job_id, cv_match_rate, cv_feedback, project_score, project_feedback, overall_summary, metadata, created_at)
```

#### Job Queue & Long-Running Handling
- **Queue**: Redis-backed Asynq for reliable job processing
- **Worker**: Dedicated worker process with configurable concurrency
- **States**: queued → processing → completed/failed
- **Resilience**: Exponential backoff, max retries, dead letter queue

### LLM Integration

#### Provider Rationale
- **Primary**: OpenRouter for model diversity and fallback options
- **Secondary**: OpenAI GPT-4 for high-quality evaluations
- **Mock Mode**: Deterministic responses for testing and development

#### Prompt Design
1. **System Prompts**: Structured JSON-only outputs with clear evaluation criteria
2. **Two-Pass Processing**: Initial evaluation + normalization pass for consistency
3. **Chain-of-Thought Safety**: Server-side validation to prevent CoT leakage
4. **Sentence Limits**: 1-3 sentences for feedback, 3-5 for summaries

#### LLM Chaining
```
CV Text → Extract Skills → Match with Job → Score (0-1)
                                ↓
Project Text → Extract Deliverables → Match with Rubric → Score (1-10)
                                ↓
                        Combine Scores → Generate Summary
```

#### RAG Strategy
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant for semantic search
- **Collections**: job_descriptions, scoring_rubrics
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small with caching
- **Retrieval**: Weight-aware re-ranking with top-k=5
- **Seeding**: Auto-seed on startup from YAML configs

### Resilience & Error Handling

#### Timeouts
- HTTP requests: 30s default, 5m for uploads
- LLM calls: 60s with context deadline
- Queue jobs: 5m max execution time

#### Retries
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
- Max attempts: 3 for LLM, 5 for queue jobs
- Circuit breaker pattern for upstream services

#### Randomness Control
- Temperature: 0.3 for consistency
- Top-p: 0.9 for controlled creativity
- Seed parameter where supported
- Validation layer for output stability

### Edge Cases Considered

#### Input Scenarios
1. **Large Files**: Enforced 10MB limit with early rejection
2. **Malicious Files**: Content sniffing, MIME validation, executable rejection
3. **Corrupted PDFs**: Graceful fallback to empty text extraction
4. **Non-English Content**: Language detection with warning in feedback
5. **Duplicate Submissions**: Idempotency keys prevent double processing

#### System Scenarios
1. **LLM Provider Outage**: Fallback to mock mode or secondary provider
2. **Database Connection Loss**: Health checks and circuit breakers
3. **Queue Overflow**: Rate limiting and backpressure
4. **Memory Pressure**: Streaming for large files, bounded caches
5. **Concurrent Evaluations**: Worker pool with semaphore limits

#### Testing Approach
- Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests with testcontainers
- E2E tests with real services
- Load testing with k6 scripts
- Chaos engineering with failure injection

### Results & Reflection

#### What Worked Well
1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear boundaries made testing and maintenance easier
2. **OpenAPI-First**: Contract-driven development prevented API drift
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and tracing aided debugging
4. **Mock Mode**: Enabled offline development and deterministic testing
5. **RAG Implementation**: Improved evaluation quality with context injection

#### What Didn't Work
1. **Initial Token Limits**: Had to implement chunking for large documents
2. **Embedding Costs**: Required aggressive caching to control expenses
3. **PDF Extraction**: Apache Tika sometimes struggled with complex layouts
4. **Rate Limits**: Needed careful tuning of concurrent LLM calls
5. **Cold Starts**: Vector DB seeding added startup latency

#### Stability Rationale
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate processing on retries
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simpler evaluation on errors
- **Health Checks**: Proactive monitoring prevents cascading failures
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup prevents unbounded growth
- **Structured Logging**: Enables quick issue diagnosis

### Future Improvements

#### Trade-offs Made
1. **Embedding Model**: Chose smaller model for cost vs larger for accuracy
2. **Storage**: PostgreSQL for simplicity vs specialized document store
3. **Queue**: Redis/Asynq for ease vs Kafka for scale
4. **Deployment**: VPS for cost vs managed cloud for reliability

#### Constraints
1. **Budget**: Limited LLM API calls require careful optimization
2. **Time**: 5-day deadline necessitated pragmatic choices
3. **Infrastructure**: VPS deployment limits horizontal scaling
4. **Model Access**: Dependent on third-party API availability

#### Planned Enhancements
1. **Multi-Language Support**: Expand beyond English evaluations
2. **Batch Processing**: Enable bulk CV evaluations
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Custom model for domain-specific evaluation
4. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket for live progress tracking
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Aggregate evaluation insights
6. **A/B Testing**: Compare different evaluation strategies
7. **Feedback Loop**: Learn from human corrections
8. **Export Formats**: PDF reports with visualizations

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Metrics
- **Upload Latency**: <2s for 5MB files
- **Evaluation Time**: 15-30s average end-to-end
- **Throughput**: 100 evaluations/hour with current limits
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during testing

### Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: Strict file type and size limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket per IP
- **Secret Management**: SOPS encryption for sensitive data
- **CORS**: Configurable allowed origins
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, XSS protection

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ for core packages

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline comments
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the integration of backend engineering with AI workflows to solve a real-world recruitment challenge. The system provides accurate, consistent evaluations while maintaining high reliability and observability standards. The clean architecture and comprehensive testing ensure the codebase is maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.

The experience gained from handling LLM unpredictability, implementing RAG, and building resilient distributed systems will be valuable for future AI-powered applications. The project serves as a solid foundation for a production-ready CV evaluation service.
