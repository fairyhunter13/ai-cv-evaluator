  - `test/e2e/smoke_random_e2e_test.go`
- Updated Makefile: `test-e2e` runs with `E2E_FAST=1` and `-timeout=10s`

#### Test Data Enhancement
- Added 10 CV/Project pairs under `test/testdata/`
- Files: `cv_01.txt`..`cv_10.txt`, `project_01.txt`..`project_10.txt`

#### Quality Gates

- RAG integration with Qdrant vector database
- Proper scoring rubric implementation
- Error handling and stability controls

### ✅ Frontend
- Vue 3 + Vite admin dashboard
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture

### ✅ Testing
- Unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- E2E tests with fast execution
- Integration tests with testcontainers
- Performance and load testing

### ✅ Observability
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Jaeger tracing
- Comprehensive logging

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Validate E2E tests** - Ensure both tests run via `make test-e2e` (≤10s locally)
2. **Add negative test cases** - Include empty CV, noisy CV, malformed encoding
3. **Document client behavior** - Add timeout behavior and expected runtime to README.md
4. **Consider nightly E2E** - Separate workflow for comprehensive testing

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance optimization** - Further optimize processing times
2. **Monitoring improvements** - Enhanced alerting and dashboards
3. **Security hardening** - Additional security measures
4. **Scalability** - Horizontal scaling improvements

## Project Health
