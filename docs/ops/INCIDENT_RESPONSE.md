### 2. Incident Detection

#### 2.1 Automated Detection

**Monitoring Alerts**
```yaml
# Critical alerts
- alert: ServiceDown
  expr: up == 0
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Service is down"

- alert: HighErrorRate
  expr: rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "High error rate detected"

- alert: DatabaseDown
  expr: pg_up == 0
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Database is down"
```

**Health Check Monitoring**
```bash
# Application health checks
curl -f http://localhost:8080/healthz || echo "Health check failed"

# Database health checks
docker exec ai-cv-evaluator-db pg_isready -U postgres

# Queue health checks
rpk cluster health | grep -q "Healthy: true" || echo "Queue unhealthy"
```

#### 2.2 Manual Detection

**User Reports**
- Support ticket analysis
- User feedback monitoring
- Social media monitoring
- Community forum monitoring

**System Monitoring**
- Log analysis
- Performance metrics review
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Error rate analysis

### 3. Incident Response Process

#### 3.1 Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

**Immediate Actions**
1. **Acknowledge the incident**
   ```bash
   # Create incident ticket
   echo "INCIDENT: $(date) - $(description)" >> /var/log/incidents.log
   
   # Notify team
   curl -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" \
     -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"text":"ðŸš¨ INCIDENT: '$(description)'"}'
   ```

2. **Assess severity and impact**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/readyz
   
   # Check resource usage
   docker stats --no-stream
   
   # Check error logs
   docker logs ai-cv-evaluator-app --tail 100 | grep ERROR
   ```

3. **Activate incident response team**
   - Incident Commander (IC)
   - Technical Lead
   - Communications Lead
   - Customer Success Lead

#### 3.2 Investigation Phase (15-60 minutes)

**System Analysis**
```bash
# Check application logs
docker logs ai-cv-evaluator-app --tail 1000 | grep -E "(ERROR|FATAL|PANIC)"

# Check database status
docker exec ai-cv-evaluator-db psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check queue status
rpk cluster health
rpk group describe ai-cv-evaluator-workers

# Check worker processes
docker ps | grep worker
docker logs ai-cv-evaluator-worker --tail 100
```

**Performance Analysis**
```bash
# Check response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:8080/healthz

# Check resource usage
docker stats --no-stream --format "table {{.Container}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"

# Check queue metrics
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=queue_lag_seconds
```

**Root Cause Analysis**
```bash
# Check recent deployments
git log --oneline -10

# Check configuration changes
git diff HEAD~1 docker-compose.yml

# Check environment variables
docker exec ai-cv-evaluator-app env | grep -E "(DB_|KAFKA_|AI_)"
```

#### 3.3 Resolution Phase (1-4 hours)

**Immediate Mitigation**
```bash
# Restart services if needed
docker compose restart app worker

# Scale workers if queue backlog
docker compose up -d --scale worker=16

# Clear queue if corrupted
rpk topic delete evaluate-jobs
rpk topic create evaluate-jobs --partitions 3
```

**Service Restoration**
```bash
# Verify service health
curl -f http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl -f http://localhost:8080/readyz

# Test critical functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/upload \
  -F "cv=@test.txt" \
  -F "project=@test.txt"

# Monitor for stability
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz'
```

#### 3.4 Recovery Phase (4-24 hours)

**System Stabilization**
```bash
# Monitor system metrics
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up

# Check performance metrics
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Verify data integrity
docker exec ai-cv-evaluator-db psql -U postgres -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs;"
```
